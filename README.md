# Do you like Jaz\*... custom created memory alloc which use avl Tree ?

So I have one right here. Is it a legit one ? Umm =. = Idk you can just take and test it. In other words do with the source code what ever you what. It should be compatible with Linux/Windows OS so it kinda have no problems with OS, but still you should be aware of that this code still can be improved (I'm a bit lazy for that sorry (^, ^))
